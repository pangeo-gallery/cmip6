    "# Estimating Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) in CMIP6 models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors:** [Henry Drake](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/hdrake) and [Ryan Abernathey](https://ocean-transport.github.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adapted from** https://github.com/hdrake/cmip6-temperature-demo/blob/master/notebooks/01_calculate_ECS_Gregory_method.ipynb \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*Definition:* Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity is defined as change in global-mean near-surface air temperature (GMST) change due to an instantaneous doubling of CO$_{2}$ concentrations and once the coupled ocean-atmosphere-sea ice system has acheived a statistical equilibrium (i.e. at the top-of-atmosphere, incoming solar shortwave radiation is balanced by reflected solar shortwave and outgoing thermal longwave radiation).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the [\"Gregory method\"](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2003GL018747) to approximate the ECS of CMIP6 models based on the first 150 years after an abrupt quadrupling of CO$_{2}$ concentrations. The \"Gregory Method\" extrapolates the quasi-linear relationship between GMST and radiative imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere to estimate how much warming would occur if the system were in radiative balance at the top-of-atmosphere, which is by definition the equilibrium response. In particular, we extrapolate the linear relationship that occurs between 100 and 150 years after the abrupt quadrupling. Since the radiative forcing due to CO$_{2}$ is a logarithmic function of the CO$_{2}$ concentration, the GMST change from a first doubling is roughly the same as for a second doubling (to first order, we can assume feedbacks as constant), which means that the GMST change due to a quadrupling of CO$_{2}$ is roughly $\\Delta T_{4 \\times \\text{CO}_{2}} = 2 \\times \\text{ECS}$. See also [Mauritsen et al. 2019](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2018MS001400) for a detailed application of the Gregory Method (with modifications) for the case of one specific CMIP6 model, the MPI-M Earth System Model.\n",

    "[intake-esm](https://intake-esm.readthedocs.io/) enables loading data directly into an [xarray.DataArray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/api.html#dataset), a metadata-aware extension of numpy arrays. `xarray` objects leverage [dask](https://dask.org/) to only read data into memory as needed for any specific operation (i.e. lazy evaluation). Think of `xarray` Datasets as ways of conveniently organizing large arrays of floating point numbers (e.g. climate model data) on an n-dimensional discrete grid, with important metadata such as units, variable, names, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that data on the cloud are in [zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) format, an extension of the metadata-aware format [netcdf](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) commonly used in geosciences.\n",

    "#### Choice of simulated forcing experiments\n",

    "Here, we choose the `piControl` experiment (in which CO2 concentrations are held fixed at a pre-industrial level of ~300 ppm) and `abrupt-4xCO2` experiment (in which CO2 concentrations are instantaneously quadrupled - or doubled twice - from a pre-industrial controrl state). Since the radiative forcing of CO2 is roughly a logarithmic function of CO2 concentrations, the ECS is roughly independent of the initial CO2 concentration. Thus, if one doubling of CO2 results in $ECS$ of warming, then two doublings (or, a quadrupling) results in $2 \\times ECS$ of warming.\n",
